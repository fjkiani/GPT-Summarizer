This script extracts text from a given file or URL and splits it into sections. It then uses OpenAI's tokenizer to encode the text as a sequence of tokens. It writes the extracted text to an output file and writes each section to a separate text file. It also generates a summary for each subsection and writes the summary to a summary file. If there are multiple summary files for a section, it generates a combined section summary.

The script expects a PDF or HTML file path, or an HTML URL, to be passed as a command line argument. It extracts the text from the PDF file, splits the text into sections, and uses the tiktoken.get_encoding function to encode the text as a sequence of tokens using the "gpt2" encoding. It writes the extracted text to an output file using the base_name of the file and the .txt extension.

It processes each section by first using the split_section_into_subsections function to split the section into subsections based on HTML section headings or numbered section headings. If necessary, it further splits any subsections into paragraphs and recombine adjacent ones until they exceed 1000 tokens. It processes each resulting section/part with InstructGPT (text-davinci-003) to generate a summary, and writes each section summary to a summary file. If there are multiple summary files for a section, it generates a combined section summary by concatenating the summaries of the individual subsections.

It then performs one final round of summarization across all the lower-level summaries, to produce an overall summary of the paper/article.
